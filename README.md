[lasr](https://github.com/donald-keighley/lasr) is a package designed
for reading and writing [Log Ascii Standard
(LAS)](https://www.cwls.org/products/) files in R. Currently it is in
the beta testing stages. As such, it is subject to significant ongoing
changes and is not complete. For instance it can’t write LAS files yet…

## Goals

lasr is primarily designed to import LAS files at high speed and in
large batches. To accomplish this, most of it is written in C++ and
connected to R with [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/). It stores the data in
lists of [data.table’s](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) for
fast manipulation.

Currently, the focus is on supporting reading [LAS
3.0](https://www.cwls.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LAS_3_File_Structure.pdf)
as fully as possible. There will be some effort to handle non-standard
LAS files but nothing too cute. lasr is being written to load files
using as little information from the header as possible which should
alleviate many common issues. Beyond that, the aim is to output helpful
error messages so that non-standard files can be fixed. Afterall, one of
the great things about LAS files is that they are human readable and can
often be fixed using a simple text editor.

[**lasr**](https://github.com/donald-keighley/lasr) is not designed to
accomplish traditional petrophysical workflows and there are no plans to
do so. There’s plenty of industry software for that. lasr is intended as
a building block to facilitate people doing new and creative things with
large volumes of log data. It’s also intended to help build up the
library of geoscience packages for R.

For a more traditional approach, or if you’d prefer to use Python, you
should check out the excellent
[**lasio**](https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.

## Installation

You can install [**lasr**](https://github.com/donald-keighley/lasr) from
github using the
[`install_github`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/1.13.6/topics/install_github)
function from the [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package. You
will need to install
[RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first since the
package needs compilation.

``` r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('https://github.com/donald-keighley/lasr')
```

Currently, the only function is `read.las` which will import a vector of
LAS file paths into a multi-part list. Each section of the file is
stored as a separate element. In order to accomodate LAS 3.0 files which
may have multiple log data sections, the log parameter, log definition,
and log data are combined into numbered log elements. If your vector of
paths contains more than one file, the output list will have an element
for each file.

Here is an example reading a single LAS file that is included with the
package:

``` r
library(lasr)
las = read.las(system.file("extdata", "las_3_cwls.las", package = "lasr"))

#Display the WELL section
head(las$well, 10)
```

Most LAS files are version 2 and only have one log data section. If you
know this is the case you can set `flatten = TRUE` and only the first
log section will be returned. This makes referencing the log data
quicker.

``` r
las = read.las(system.file("extdata", "las_3_cwls.las", package = "lasr"), flatten=TRUE)
head(las$log$data, 10)
```

## Speed Test

Since the purpose of this package is to load LAS files as quickly as
possible, a speed test is included here with a comparison to python’s
[**lasio**](https://lasio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). First,
download a test dataset from the KGS website. In this case we’re using
the [2016 logs](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/PRS/Scans/Log_Summary/2016.zip)
data. Download and unzip them into a folder called *“C:/temp/logs”*, or
modify the code for wherever you put it.

Next, import the first 500 files. We’ll use 4 threads for this
comparison, although if you have more cores you can increase the number
of threads to speed it up further. Only use this option if you are
importing more than a handful of files, otherwise the parallel overhead
will slow it down.

``` r
files = list.files('C:/temp/logs', pattern = '.las?', full.names=TRUE)
start.time = Sys.time()
las = read.las(files[1:500],nthreads=4)
end.time = Sys.time()
time.taken = end.time - start.time
time.taken
```

    ## Time difference of 25.96407 secs

Now in Python in parallel using 4 cores:

``` python
import lasio, glob, datetime, multiprocessing
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

num_cores = 4
files = glob.glob('C:/temp/logs/*.las')
start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    las = Parallel(n_jobs=num_cores)(delayed(lasio.read)(file) for file in files[0:499])
end_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print('Duration: {}'.format(end_time - start_time))
```

    ## Duration: 0:04:45.961226

Clearly, lasr is faster, however, please don’t take this as a shot at
lasio. The primary goal of this package is speed, and as such countless
hours have been put into speed testing, de-bottlenecking, and enduring
the pain of writing in C++. As with anything, there are tradeoffs, and
lasr errs toward speed where lasio tends more toward user convenience.
They are simply different products.

Good luck, and if you have any suggestions reach out!
